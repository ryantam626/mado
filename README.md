# Mado

## Overview
This is a personalised window manager designed for my specific workflow, works only for modern Windows OS.

This is meant to be used along side a keyboard remapper to avoid interference with other existing keybind of other application, I use [my fork of kmonad](https://github.com/ryantam626/kmonad).
